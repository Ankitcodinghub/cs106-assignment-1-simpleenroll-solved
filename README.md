Overview

Part 0: Read the code + Class struct

Part 1: parse_csv

Part 2: write_courses_offered Part 3: write_courses_not_offered Congrats you‚Äôre done!

Overview

It‚Äôs that time of the quarter again; time to use SimpleEnroll again Wootwoot.

One thing everyone realizes in their Stanford career at one point is that they have to eventually graduate ‚Äî and so enrolling in classes becomes a strategic endeavor to maximize the XP towards graduation, while also being able to sleep more than 4 hours a night!

In this hopefully short assignment, we‚Äôre going to use data from the ExploreCourses API to figure out which CS classes on ExploreCourses are offered this year, and which are not! We‚Äôll be taking advantage of streams, while also exercising initialization and references in C++. Lets jump in  ï‚Ä¢ÃÅ·¥•‚Ä¢ÃÄ î„Å£

There are really only two files you should care about: utils.cpp Main.cpp

Please do the following to download the starter code here! Please unzip the file.

Part 0: Read the code + add paths + Course struct

1) Take a look at the main.cpp function, and take special notice of how vector_of_courses is passed into parse_csv, write_courses_offered, and write_courses_not_offered. Think about what these functions are doing, do you need to change anything in the function definition? Spoiler, you

do.

2) In the main.cpp and utils.cpp you need to manually add paths to the code. Here‚Äôs how you can do this.

a) In VSCode:

Paste the path of

‚óè courses_offered.csv as a string in the variable std::string

COURSES_OFFERED_CSV_PATH

‚óè courses_not_offered.csv as a string in the variable std::string COURSES_NOT_OFFERED_CSV_PATH

3) Write the correct types for the fields in the Course struct. Remember what types streams deal with?

Part 1: parse_csv

Check out courses.csv, it is a csv file, with three columns: Title, Number of Units, and Quarter. Implement parse_csv so that, for each line in the csv file, it creates a struct Course containing the Title, Number of Units, and Quarter for that line.

A couple of things you need to think about:

1) How are you going to read in courses.csv? Muahahaha, perhaps a stream ?

2) How will you get each line in the file?

Hints:

1) Make use of the split function we provide to get a vector that looks like the following: [Title, Number of Units, Quarter]

a) Check out the implementation ‚Äì ask us any questions about it ‚Äì you should be able to reason about it since it‚Äôs using a stringstream

Part 2: write_courses_offered

Ok. Now you have a populated vector_of_courses which has all of the records of the courses.csv file neatly stored in a Course struct! You find yourself interested in only the courses that are offered, right? In this function, write out to student_output/courses_offered.csv all the courses that don‚Äôt have ‚Äúnull‚Äù or the quarter field.

IMPORTANT ‚Üí When writing out to the file please follow this format:

&lt;Title&gt;,&lt;Number of Units&gt;,&lt;Quarter&gt;

There are no spaces between the commas! The autograder will not be happy if this format is not followed!

Additionally, keep track of the classes that are offered perhaps with another vector and delete them from vector_of_courses. This means that after this function runs, vector_of_courses should ONLY contain classes that are not offered! For this, be sure to take a look at the PROVIDED function: delete_elem_from_vector!

Don‚Äôt worry, I know you‚Äôre wondering what this is: auto it = std::find(v.begin(), v.end(), elem);

We got you‚Ä¶‚Ä¶in like 3 weeks.

Part 3: write_courses_not_offered

So you‚Äôre curious about classes that aren‚Äôt offered‚Ä¶curiosity hurt the cat. In the write_courses_not_offered function, write out to student_output/courses_offered.csv the classes in vector_of_courses. Remember since you deleted the classes that are offered in part 2, vector_of_courses trivially contains ONLY classes that are not offered ‚Äì lucky you. So this step should look really similar to part 2 except shorter and a tiny bit simpler

Congrats you‚Äôre done!

Plz leave feedback here!

Shoutout

A special thank you to Jim Sproch for providing the ExploreCourses API. After an unsuccessful attempt to web-scrape the ExploreCourses website, I was directed to Jim Sproch who was kind enough to not only provide us the API but also answer our questions about its use!
